# [Surf-Tribe](https://surf-tribe.herokuapp.com/)
The beach is calling.

## Inspiration
As a part of Surfs Up hacks we decided to make something that contributes to our environment. We wanted to make a hack that inspires people to think about our oceans, beaches and motivates them to volunteer for clean-ups.

## What it does
**Surf-Tribe** is a web application that registers you for clean up drives organised for beaches near you. Through our app, you can find a community of people who are willing to contribute their share in conserving nature. Join with hundreds of such people and play your part.

## How we built it
The front end of our application is done using __HTML, CSS.__ The backend is done using __Node, Express, MongoDB__.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating Google Maps API was difficult in our application. We replaced that with a simple text box containing address of nearest beach. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to put a fully functional website at the end of the hackathon. We are proud of our teamwork and ability to adjust in our roles according to needs.

## What we learned
We learnt the integration of a database in a project using __node__ and __express__. We became better at the designing process of a website.

## What's next for Surf-Tribe
1. A Google maps API integration for easy navigation to the nearest beach
2. Voice assistant in the website
3. Better UI/UX design
